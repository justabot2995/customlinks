## Install

###### Clone the repository
To install simply clone the repository with the command below or download the latest zip from the release page.

```
git clone https://github.com/justabot2995/customlinks
```

###### Deploy to your preferred website service
From there you'll need to use your preferred service provider to deploy the site, such as [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). I recommend testing the generic template with your service provider first, to ensure the website will build correctly. However, most services should *just work* since the template is built over the standard HTML, CSS and JS frameworks.

###### Configure and tweak as needed
After that feel free to configure the site as needed. To do that locally I recommend using something like [VSCodium]() with the [Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) and the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extensions. Follow on to more details about the configuration process.
